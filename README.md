# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

HAR has emerged as a key research area because of its usefulness for many applications. <br>
For this project, we will be recognizing the physical activities of humans using sensors put on their body. <br>
Three different machine learning algorithms will be used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks
